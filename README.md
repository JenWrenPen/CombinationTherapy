Data &amp; code for the paper "A computational dynamic model of combination treatment for type II inhibitors with asciminib" by J. Roadnight Sheehan, Astrid S. de Wijn, and Ran Friedman.
For type II inhibitor resistant mutants the Model.py file is the model used for the work. The input data required for this is contained in the MutationLookUpTable.py. 
For the asciminib resistant mutants, featured in the supporting information, the ModelAsc.py file is the model used for the work. The input data required for this is contained in the MutationLookUpTableAsc.py.
